You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\dell\signup-with-storage-bucket\web

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.

[info] Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
[info] A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
[info] with sample code pre-configured.

[info] See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
[info] more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

[info] Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
